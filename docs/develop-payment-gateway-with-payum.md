# Develop payment gateway with payum

This chapter could be useful for those developer who want create a gateway client using payum as base.
Here we would briefly describe what you should start from.
Let's assume you want to implement the most common task: purchase something and getting its status.

_**Note**: We would suggest to read (the architecture)[the-architecture.md] chapter before you proceed here._

## Capture action.

Purchasing will be done by `CaptureAction`. This action will contain all payment related logic.
We assume you use `ArrayObject` as model but you of course may change it to what ever you want.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Payum\Action;

use Payum\Action\ActionInterface;
use Payum\Request\CaptureRequest;

class CaptureAction extends ActionInterface
{
    public function execute($request)
    {
        $model = $request->getModel();

        if ($model['amount'] && $model['currency']) {
            //do purchase and set status.
            $model['status'] = 'success';
        } else {
            $model['error'] = 'success';
        }
    }

    public function supports($request)
    {
        return
            $request instanceof CaptureRequest &&
            $request->getModel() instanceof \ArrayAccess
        ;
    }
}
```

## Status action.

`StatusAction` would contain all the rules of payment status.
The action must make your decisions on the model you pass with request.
Let's assume your model have `status` field and it can be either success or error.

```php
<?php
namespace App\Payum\Action;

use Payum\Action\ActionInterface;
use Payum\Request\StatusRequestInterface;

class StatusAction extends ActionInterface
{
    public function execute($request)
    {
        $model = $request->getModel();

        if ('success' == $model['status']) {
            $request->markSuccess();

            return;
        }

        if ('error' == $model['status']) {
            $request->markFailed();

            return;
        }

        $request->markUnknown();
    }

    public function supports($request)
    {
        return
            $request instanceof StatusRequestInterface &&
            $request->getModel() instanceof \ArrayAccess
        ;
    }
}
```

# Usage

Now you want knit all things together and start use it. Okay,
To make it work we have to create a payment object and put all we did into it.

```php
<?php
namespace App;

App\Payum\Action\CaptureAction;
App\Payum\Action\StatusAction;
use Payum\Payment;
use Payum\Request\CaptureRequest;
use Payum\Request\BinaryMaskStatusRequest;

$payment = new Payment;
$payment->addAction(new CaptureAction);
$payment->addAction(new StatusAction);

$model = new ArrayObject(array(
    'amount' => 10,
    'currency => 'USD',
));

$payment->execute(new CaptureRequest($model));
$payment->execute($status = new BinaryMaskStatusRequest($model));

if ($status->isSuccess()) {
    echo 'We purchase staff successfully';
} else if ($status->isFaild()) {
    echo 'An error occured';
} else {
    echo 'Something went wrong but we don`t know the exact status';
}
```

Enjoy!
